    <h3>Self Introduction
Hello, my name is Amit Shastri. I am a B.Tech student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, with a strong interest in technology, innovation, and personal growth. I have completed my 12th standard from Lord Rama English School, Gautampura, where I developed a solid academic foundation.
My academic focus includes machine learning fundamentals, programming, data analysis, and problem-solving. I am continuously working on improving my technical skills and gaining practical exposure to AI-driven systems and intelligent technologies through learning and hands-on practice.
Alongside my technical journey, my short-term goal is to pursue modelling. Modelling helps me build confidence, presentation skills, body language, and self-discipline, which also strengthen my communication and professional personality. My long-term goal is to establish myself as a skilled professional in the AI & ML field, creating a balance between technical expertise and creative expression.
I have a strong interest in acting and playing football, which have helped me develop teamwork, discipline, and adaptability. My key strengths include confidence, analytical thinking, and the ability to learn from everyone. I am aware of my emotional sensitivity and short temper, and I am actively working on self-control and emotional intelligence.
I value honesty, hard work, and continuous improvement, and I aim to grow both personally and professionally by combining technology, creativity, and confidence.</h2>

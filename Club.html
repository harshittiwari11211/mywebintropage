    <h2>This picture captures a proud moment when our team won First Prize in an Inter-College Nukkad Natak Competition. In this performance, I portrayed the role of a cigarette addict, highlighting the social and health issues related to substance abuse through impactful street theatre.
I am an active member of Rangpeeth – The Theatre Club of SVVV College, where I regularly participate in stage plays, street performances, and socially driven theatrical activities. Theatre has helped me develop strong expression, confidence, teamwork, and character-building skills, while allowing me to convey meaningful messages to society through performance.</h2>
